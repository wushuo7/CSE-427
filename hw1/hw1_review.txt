 I not very like this homework, but I fully understand how important it is. Since, itâ€™s the beginning of this semester, so we need to learn some basic knowledge about big data and data mining etc. I think the article that assigned to read is a little boring, I prefer to learn new knowledge from the class slides. However, I like the question 2 in homework one, since the math model makes me know the knowledge better, I design the math formula myself, I like the designing process, I learn a lot of things from the model.
